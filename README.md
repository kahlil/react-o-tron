# REACT-O-TRON

> The ultimate template for creating an Electron app with Create-React-App.

So far I just stole [this](https://dev.to/nickparsons/takeaways-on-building-a-react-based-app-with-electron-1df2) and updated the dependencies and added greenkeeper to the repo.

The goal is to refine this and always keep it up to date.

The setup is already very powerful and straight forward. Just [use this repository as a template](https://github.com/kahlil/react-o-tron/generate), clone your new repo, `yarn` all the things and then `yarn start`.
